# Fibonacci-series
In this project i built a program that shows you the terms of the Fibonacci series chosen by the user.

## What is Fibonacci series?
In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fnâ€Š, form a sequence, the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The sequence commonly starts from 0 and 1, although some authors omit the initial terms and start the sequence from 1 and 1 or from 1 and 2. [More info about the Fibonacci series here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number)

## Program
As you can see, there are two programs. Both programs do the same thing but one was written in C++ and the other in Python.
